Proposition 15 and Ending the Politics of Scarcity​

We were motivated to research Prop 15 because we know that lack of funds hinders our ability to pay for school and community services (e.g., fire protection and forest management), which hurts low-income communities of color the most. Prop 15 could be a vehicle to increase funding for local services by requiring large corporations (est. Before 1976) to pay their fair share in property taxes.
   
 To explore this issue, we ask the following questions:
 1. How did local government spending change after the passage of Prop 13? ​
 2. Has funding for essential services kept pace with California's economic growth?​
 3. Which sectors have been impacted?​
